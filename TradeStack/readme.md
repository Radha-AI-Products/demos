# TradeStack Demo: Build a Modern Stock Trading App Front-End in Minutes with Blazor & Instruct UI

This demo showcases the source code used in the YouTube video "[From Prompt to Production UI: Building an Enterprise-Grade Blazor App with Instruct UI](https://youtu.be/vxheik1N8ME)". It highlights how quickly you can create a modern, responsive real-world application like a Stock Trading app frontend using [Instruct UI](https://instructui.com/), a conversational AI tool for Blazor UI development, styled with [Syncfusion Blazor](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run or build this Blazor demo, which is featured in the linked YouTube video, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **[.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download):** The latest supported .NET SDK is required to run Blazor applications.
* **A code editor (Optional but recommended):** For an enhanced development experience, consider using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with the C# extension, or JetBrains Rider.


## How to Build the Demo (as seen in the YouTube video)

Follow these steps to build and run the TradeStack demo application, as demonstrated in the YouTube video:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Radha-AI-Products/demos.git
    cd demos/TradeStack
    ```

2.  **Run the Blazor application:** In the same terminal (still within the project directory), run the Blazor application using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

3.  **Access the application in your browser:** Once the build and run process is complete, the terminal will display the URL where the application is hosted (usually something like `https://localhost:xxxx` or `http://localhost:xxxx`). Open this URL in your web browser to view the TradeStack UI.

4.  **Explore the TradeStack UI:** You can now interact with the TradeStack demo, showcasing Blazor components built with Instruct UI and styled with Syncfusion Blazor, just as shown in the YouTube video. The app includes the following pages:
    - **Dashboard** – Overview of portfolio performance and market summary
    - **Markets** – Live market data and stock listings
    - **Portfolio** – Track your holdings and their performance
    - **Orders** – View and manage trade orders
    - **Watchlist** – Monitor your favorite stocks
    - **Analytics** – In-depth charts and trading analytics
    - **Profile** – User profile and account settings

5.  **Conclusion:** Now that you have the TradeStack demo set up, you can explore and modify the application as needed. Feel free to make changes, experiment, and build your own stock trading app using Blazor and InstructUI.
