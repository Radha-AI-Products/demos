# BudgetBuddy Demo: Build a Modern Budget App Front-End in Minutes with Blazor & Instruct UI

This demo showcases the source code used in the YouTube video "[Build an BudgetBuddy Front-End in Minutes Using Blazor & Instruct UI](https://youtu.be/EfuOXulAIjI)". It highlights how quickly you can create a modern, responsive Budget Maintaining app UI using [Instruct UI](https://instructui.com/), a conversation AI tool for Blazor UI development, styled with [Mudblazor](https://www.mudblazor.com/).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run or build this Blazor demo, which is featured in the linked YouTube video, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **[.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download):** The latest supported .NET SDK is required to run Blazor applications.
* **A code editor (Optional but recommended):** For an enhanced development experience, consider using Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with the C# extension, or JetBrains Rider.


## How to Build the Demo (as seen in the YouTube video)

Follow these steps to build and run the BudgetBuddy demo application, as demonstrated in the YouTube video:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Radha-AI-Products/demos.git
    cd demos/BudgetBuddy
    ```

2.  **Run the Blazor application:** In the same terminal (still within the project directory),run the Blazor application using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
3.  **Access the application in your browser:** Once the build and run process is complete, the terminal will display the URL where the application is hosted (usually something like `https://localhost:xxxx` or `http://localhost:xxxx`). Open this URL in your web browser to view the BudgetBuddy's UI.

4.  **Explore the BudgetBuddy UI:** You can now interact with the BudgetBuddy demo, showcasing Blazor components built with Instruct UI and styled with MudBlazor, just as shown in the YouTube video.

5.  **Conclusion:** Now that you have the BudgetBuddy demo set up, you can explore and modify the application as needed. Feel free to make changes, experiment, and build your own travel planning app using Blazor and InstructUI.
