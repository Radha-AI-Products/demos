# TripMate Demo

This demo showcases a user interface for TripMate, a modern responsive travel planning app. The UI is developed using [InstructUI](https://instructui.com/), a Blazor-based UI development tool, and styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a modern and responsive design.

## Built With

* [InstructUI](https://instructui.com/): A Blazor-based platform for rapidly developing user interfaces.
* [Blazor](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor): A framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

## Overview

This demo provides a glimpse into the potential user experience of TripMate, built using the InstructUI Blazor framework. Each page and component within this demo has been generated and integrated locally, leveraging the power of Blazor for dynamic and interactive web development. Tailwind CSS has been utilized to provide a consistent and visually appealing style across the application, managed through npm.

## Key Features (Adapt based on your demo's actual features)

* **InstructUI Integration:** Showcases how InstructUI accelerates the development of Blazor components and pages.
* **Blazor-Powered UI:** Demonstrates the interactive capabilities and component-based architecture of a Blazor application built with InstructUI.
* **Tailwind CSS Styling (via npm):** Highlights the integration of Tailwind CSS, managed and built using npm scripts.
  
## Prerequisites

Before you can run or build this Blazor demo, you will need to have the following installed on your system:

* **[.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download):** Ensure you have the latest supported .NET SDK installed. Blazor runs on .NET.
* **A code editor (Optional but recommended):** While you can build and run the application from the command line, a code editor like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code with the C# extension, or JetBrains Rider can enhance your development experience.
* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):** Node.js is required to run npm, which is used to manage Tailwind CSS dependencies and build the CSS.
* **[npm (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/):** npm comes bundled with Node.js. You'll use it to install Tailwind CSS and run build scripts.

## How to Build the Demo

The build process involves both building the Blazor application using the .NET CLI and building the Tailwind CSS using npm.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL here]
    cd demos/TripMate
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:** Ensure you are in the main project directory containing the `.csproj` file and the `package.json` file.

3.  **Install Tailwind CSS dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt within the project directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command installs all the necessary Tailwind CSS and related packages defined in your `package.json` file.

4.  **Build Tailwind CSS:** Once the dependencies are installed, run the npm script that builds your CSS. This script is usually defined in the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file. Look for scripts like `build:css`, `tailwind:build`, `css:build`, or similar. Execute it like this:
    ```bash
    npm run css:build
    ```

5.  **Build the Blazor application:** In the same terminal (within the project directory), build the Blazor application using the .NET CLI:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```
    This compiles your Blazor code and integrates the static assets, including the built CSS in `wwwroot/css/app.css` (or your specified output path).

## How to Run the Demo

After building both the Tailwind CSS and the Blazor application:

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:** Ensure you are in the main project directory containing the `.csproj` file.

2.  **Run the Blazor application:** Use the .NET CLI to run the application:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

3.  **Access the application in your browser:** Once the application builds and starts, the terminal will typically display the URL where the application is running (usually `https://localhost:xxxx` or `http://localhost:xxxx`). Open this URL in your web browser.

4.  **Explore the TripMate UI:** You should now be able to interact with the TripMate demo, with the Blazor components generated by InstructUI and styled with the Tailwind CSS built using npm.
